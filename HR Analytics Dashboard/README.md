# **HR Analytics Dashboard**

The "HR Analytics Dashboard" project involved a comprehensive analysis of human resources data aimed at understanding employee dynamics and attrition within an organization. Through proficient data analysis in Microsoft Excel, several key insights and visualizations were derived:

- **Total Employees by Gender**: The project provided a gender-based breakdown of the organization's workforce, offering insights into gender diversity and representation.

- **Attrition by Department**: By examining attrition rates within different departments, the project revealed which areas of the organization were experiencing higher turnover. This information is crucial for HR planning and departmental improvements.

- **Attrition by Group**: The analysis segmented employees into groups to identify patterns in attrition. This segmentation could be based on various factors, such as age groups or experience levels, offering valuable insights into the characteristics of employees most likely to leave the organization.

- **Attrition by Marital Status**: The project assessed attrition rates based on employees' marital status, providing insights into how this personal aspect may impact attrition.

- **Attrition by Job Role**: Employee attrition was examined within specific job roles. This allowed for a targeted approach to understanding which roles were most susceptible to attrition, enabling proactive measures to retain talent in critical positions.

The "HR Analytics Dashboard" project not only demonstrated proficiency in data analysis but also offered actionable insights for HR departments. By understanding the dynamics of gender diversity, departmental attrition, employee groups, marital status, and job roles, organizations can make more informed decisions to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover. This project exemplified the power of data-driven HR strategies for talent management and retention.
